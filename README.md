# FortuneTeller_ArrayList_RandomClass_FileClass
Initialize project FortuneTeller_ArrayList_RandomClass_FileClass

This program will use the File class to create an instance of the
a file object containing the text file name. An ArrayList is created
to store the different lines of answers contained in the text file.
The Random class is used to create a instance of random object to
be used with the size of the Arraylist as the range of numeric
values to be random returned. That returned random number will
then be used as the index number to get that particular element
from the ArrayList.
